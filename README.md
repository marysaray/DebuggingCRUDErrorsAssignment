# Debugging CRUD Errors Assignment
This assignment is to thoroughly test the website and ensuring all CRUD functionality pages are working correctly.

Your task is to ensure that:

- All hyperlinks work
- All CRUD functionality pages work
    - You will need to create the views (you may use the scaffolding or create them manually)
- Database is updated correctly for insert/update/delete

You should not have to configure the database.
There is already a configured database context class which is registered in the Startup.cs
and the configuration string is setup for you already.

Make sure you thoroughly test the website.
